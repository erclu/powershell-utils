Some (arguably) useful utilities I wrote.

## BackupAndRestoreStuff

a valiant but laughable effort to simplify my eventual transition to other pcs.

## PSPythonUtils

a project scaffolding function, and some cmdlets to manage the virtual environments created by pipenv.

## Scripts

### Get-DirtyRepos

finds repositories with local changes that are not backed up.

### Remove-EmptyFolders

pretty self explanatory.

### Set-DnsServer

switch easily between default and google DNS. Because someone thought having an eduroam hotspot that does not work with google DNS was smart.

### Start-JobWithCallback

an example of how to write a reactive asynchronous job.
